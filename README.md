Storyline
ESCAPE FROM AZKABAN
Begins with Player in cell, perhaps flashback of terrible memory? Slowly comes to realize they’re in Azkaban as memories come back (Examine floor/walls/ceiling, wait/listen, x self). Realize they were framed, and they know who the real criminal is - they just have to get out and prove it. Different possibilities for this - could be an Animagus, like Sirius, but I imagine security in Azkaban would have changed after this got out. Could have wand on them for some benign reason? Perhaps somehow sent to them by ally? As the storyline progresses, Player slowly recalls more things about past/reveals world information.

What it needs: 
Game Name: Escape from Azkaban

2.     Game Overview
What it needs:   	
Game Concept: After being convicted of a crime the Player - a now-ex-Auror - did not commit, they must escape Azkaban (and catch the true criminal?). (Pick character?) Find clues, cast spells, and perform actions to successfully escape (and complete their mission). An IF-style game, preferably with an overview at the beginning to teach basics if typing commands (if applicable). If not, select actions? (Buttons?)

3.     Gameplay and  Mechanics
What it needs:		Gameplay
Game Progression: Either level up by reaching milestones and gaining spells/allies/actions or getting points, or just gather points along the way to tally at the end of the game
Mission/challenge Structure: Though there is obviously a basic storyline (and maybe art if this becomes an arcade game? I feel like just text would be boring...but then again IF games with just text haven’t been boring for me), but if I do this right, a lot would be just up to the player’s creativity?
Objectives – What are the objectives of the game? How does it work? (do you have money involved? Are there levels to get through? etc.) End goal is obviously to escape, but possible objectives along the way include learning/remembering spells, meeting characters/magical creatures (either ocs or actual ones), discovering clues (how Player was framed, etc.) and reaching checkpoints (escaping cell/hallway/etc.)

4.     Story, Setting and Character 
Story and Narrative – what is the story behind your game? See above
Play Flow – linear narrative, first person player’s POV
Mechanics – What are the rules to the game. (This is the model of the universe that the game works under.  Think of it as a simulation of a world, how do all the pieces interact? )
Movement in the game? Arrow keys(?), typing commands, or selecting actions
Objects – perhaps? Depends on how i decide the format
				Actions in your game - casting spells, moving, examinations
Economy – ...i’m not sure if this could actually work, but maybe trust between other characters? Either that or knowledge
Game World: Azkaban, the wizard prison in Harry Potter - and if the player escapes, hopefully the outside world
Character(s): not sure if there’s going to be other characters yet
